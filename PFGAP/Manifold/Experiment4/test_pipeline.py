# The purpose of this file is so we can generate results reliably and easily

#& Tasks to Accomplish
"""
1. We need to first do an accuracy test (f1 score and accuracy) between pfgap and knn
2. An outlier detection test
3. Imputation test (NOTE: this is pending Ben's creating a wrapper for the PFGAP to do the imputation)

*All these tests should be using the seeds we have. 
*We want to store the tests in the results folder for easy lookup later
